This just tracks the states and keeps some notes about GIT repositories of git.directfb.org

Currently this is not in a really usable state, as I am in the phase to learn how DirectFB works - which can take some decades until I am compfortable with it.  So perhaps I will never succeed to get to something reasonable.

However there is one interesting part:

GIT submodules

This here is a GIT repository which tracks the state of all the other original remote repositories which reside on git.directfb.org.  As I do not want to edit there ever, only track some working state, this is the perfect solution.
